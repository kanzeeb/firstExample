    <p>
      In this story the impulse toward self-abnegation in love, which appears so
      markedly in both Vanya & Natasha, isn't itself enough to direct their
      lives; instead, it combines with their social world & the mundane
      ambitions of Prince Valkovsky to defeat their hope of happiness. Of all
      the characters in the novel, only Natasha's lover, the Prince's son
      Alyosha-the person least driven to mold life to his own terms-emerges
      untouched.
