      "One of the greatest love stories of all time," according to Henry James,
      and the inspiration for Verdi’s opera La Traviata. Known to all as “the
      Lady of the Camellias” because she is never seen without her favorite
      flowers, Marguerite Gautier, the most beautiful, brazen, and expensive
      courtesan in all of Paris. But despite having many lovers, she has never
      really loved—until she meets Armand Duval, young, handsome, and hopelessly
      in love with her.
